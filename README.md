### âš¡ Fun facts:


I have 2 adorable dogs and 4 cute cats. I like to craft things for my pets and myself, there is something incredibly fullfiling on making something usefull with your own hands. Besides, planing and researching for the materials and the how tos is really fun.

Oh, btw, Rainbow Dash makes everything 20% coolerðŸ˜Ž
